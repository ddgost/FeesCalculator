# FeesCalculator
Fees calculator for my flat. Done using Windows Presentation Foundation, MVVM pattern, and Entity Framework for dealing with Microsoft SQL Server database. Each fees is calculated by subtracting current meter count with count from preceding month. To avoid problems with first custom calculation, I added in database whole fees set for November 2018. 

Things to do in future:
- add report print feature,
- statistics page.
- various performance and exception handling fixes.
